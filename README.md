## Introduction

Pump.fun is a decentralized exchange for Solana NFTs and tokens. It is a fast, easy-to-use and secure NFT and token trading platform. Pump.fun is a platform designed for people to launch, mint, and trade new tokens, and it comes with a high level of risk. Tokens launched on Pump can be traded immediately and there will be no delays in minting. While it ensures a fair launch with no pre-sales or insider advantages, the stakes are still high. People can throw away their coins at any time, and often do.
